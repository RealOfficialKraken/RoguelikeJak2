#Rogue-Like Jak II (demo)
This mod aims to randomize the missions in Jak II depending on which "Act" you're currently in, in the story. Each mission, or "stage", the enemies become stronger... and so Jak must have to as well. Beat 5 stages per act, and beat the final boss!

- Face a permanent death feature, where you'd have to restart your run if you die!
- Gather items to boost Jak's stats, weapons, and abilities through each run
- Fight the newly refreshed boss attacks
- Collect skull gems to gain yourself more "Tokens" after you die. These are spent on items, which are bought to be put into later runs.
- Finish the custom story quest to gain access to the overpowered items, and stages.
